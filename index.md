### **Localization Performance Assessment in Wireless Sensor Network** `2019.9 - present`
Department of Communication Engineering<br>
_Research Assistant_ ，  Supervisor: Dr.Dayang Sun<br>
Research mainly focuses on putting forward new approaches in localization accuracy assessment field. <br>
My work contains enhancing algorithm models, implementing experiments of diffierent topologies in MATLAB, and writing theses in LaTex.

### **The design and research of the anti-jitter laser communication system on the basis of pulse dialing modulation** `2020.5 - 2021.9`

_Member_<br>
- College Students' Science and Technology Innovation Project
- Provincial Project
- Project Outcome:  One patent being reviewed.<br> 
In this project, a laser communication system based on pulse dialing modulation is designed to improve the time jitter performance in free space optical communication. The system implements the pulse dialing modulation at the transmitter and the signal decision and error control at the receiver through STM32 MCU programming. The receiver of this system adopts a method of multi-channel reception. The experiment results show that this system is fast, reliable and easy to realize, and its communication distance can reach 10 meters.<br> 
I designed the circut of this laser communication system,and was responsible for the whole system implementation.
